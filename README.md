# nvim


This is my Neovim configuration that I put together.

It has "sane" defaults (at least that's what I think)

It's designed to be rather minimal while having most if not all  of the needed stuff to use neovim as an IDE

to "install" it  just clone this repo into your ``.config``  directory and it should start working(though you might need a few dependencies pre installed like npm and pip)

if you have any suggestions for this  please contact me on discord. My username is  ``fkf`` (yes I have a 3 letter username)
